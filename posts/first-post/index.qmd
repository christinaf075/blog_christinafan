## Why I'm Starting This Blog

I'm starting this blog because it's an assignment for a computational research methods course
I'm taking. However, maybe if I take a liking to posting my thoughts and ideas online for 
the public, I will continue sharing whatever random content comes along, and maybe it can be 
a meaningful way for people to spend their time reading about, whether because they can connect to it
in some way, or simply to kill the time.
